## ✨ Feature Breakdown  

### 👥 User Management

Handles **user registration, authentication, and profile management**.  
This feature ensures that users can securely log in, manage their personal information, and access the platform according to their role (guest or host).  

### 🏡 Property Management

Allows users (hosts) to **create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings**.  
It ensures that all property details are accurately maintained and searchable by potential guests.  

### 📅 Booking System

Enables users to **reserve properties and manage their booking details**.  
This feature handles check-in/check-out dates, availability, and links bookings to both users and properties.  

### 💳 Payment Processing

Processes **secure transactions for bookings**.  
It records payment details, updates booking status, and ensures financial data integrity between users and hosts.  

### ⭐ Review System

Lets users **leave ratings and reviews for properties**.  
This builds trust within the platform, helps guests make informed decisions, and provides feedback to hosts.  

### ⚡ Data Optimization

Uses **indexing and caching strategies** to improve data retrieval and overall system performance.  
It ensures the backend can efficiently handle high-traffic scenarios and deliver a smooth user experience.

## 🔒 API Security  

Security is a top priority for the Airbnb Clone Backend to **protect user data, payments, and overall platform integrity**. The following measures are implemented:  

### 👤 Authentication

Users must **log in with a secure account** to access the platform.

- Protects sensitive user information (passwords, profiles).  
- Ensures that only verified users can perform actions like bookings or property management.  

### 🛡️ Authorization

Different roles (guest, host, admin) have **controlled access to resources**.

- Prevents users from accessing or modifying data they shouldn’t.  
- Ensures hosts can manage their own properties while guests only access bookings and reviews.  

### ⚡ Rate Limiting & Throttling

Limits the number of API requests per user or IP address.

- Protects the platform from **DDoS attacks** and abuse.  
- Ensures fair usage and maintains server performance for all users.  

### 🔐 Data Protection & Encryption

Sensitive data (passwords, payment details) is **encrypted in storage and in transit**.  
- Prevents unauthorized access to user accounts and payment information.  
- Ensures secure communication between clients and the backend.  

### 🧪 Security Testing

Regular testing for **vulnerabilities and potential threats**.  
- Identifies and fixes security loopholes before they affect users.  
- Maintains trust and reliability of the platform.
